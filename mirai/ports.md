# ports

ports=$(nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 <target> | grep '^[0-9]' | cut -d '/' -f 1 |
tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//)

## This line of code declares a variable named ports. The value of the variable is set by running an nmap scan with the following options:

    -p-: This option tells nmap to scan all ports.

    --min-rate=1000: This option sets the minimum number of packets per second to send.

    -T4: This option sets the timing template to use. In this case, it is set to "aggressive."

    squashed.htb: This is the target of the scan.

The output of the nmap scan is piped through several commands:

    grep '^[0-9]': This command filters the output to only show lines that start with a number. This filters out any extraneous lines from the nmap output.

    cut -d '/' -f 1: This command cuts the output at the first occurrence of a forward slash and returns only the first field. This filters out any information about the port protocol.

    tr '\n' ',': This command replaces newlines with commas. This creates a comma-separated list of ports.

    sed s/,$//: This command removes the final comma from the list.

The resulting output is a comma-separated list of open ports on the target system. This list is then assigned to the ports variable.

nmap -p$ports -sC -sV squashed.htb

This line of code runs an nmap scan on the target system with the following options:

    -p$ports: This option tells nmap to scan only the ports listed in the ports variable.

    -sC: This option tells nmap to use the default NSE scripts.

    -sV: This option tells nmap to perform version detection.

    squashed.htb: This is the target of the scan.

By using the ports variable to specify the ports to scan, this nmap command will only scan the open ports on the target system. This can save time and resources compared to scanning all ports. Additionally, by using the -sC and -sV options, this nmap scan will attempt to gather information about the services running on the open ports, which can provide valuable information for further analysis and exploitation of the target system.
